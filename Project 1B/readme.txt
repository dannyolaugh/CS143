Our php files seem to work perfectly on our machine under our interpretation of
the spec. However, in order to access our website, we had to use the following address: http://localhost:1438/~cs143/lab1b/insertM.php instead of the address beginning with 192.168.56.20 as in the video. Nevertheless, everything worked smoothly and we implemented all of the required components from the spec successfully with a relatively attractive user interface. Our interface includes a row of links to all of the website’s functionality as well as a catchy website name: J&D’s Movie Database.
